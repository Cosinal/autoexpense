# Orios.ca: Design & Architectural Blueprint
**Project Codename:** Orios (Celestial Precision)
**Target Audience:** Executives & High-End Consultants ($50M+ ARR Profiles)

## 1. Brand Identity & Visual Language

### Core Theme: "The Midnight Moonrise"
The aesthetic moves away from standard "flat" tech designs into a cinematic, high-contrast experience that evokes privacy, depth, and institutional trust.

* **Color Palette:**
    * **Space Black (#050505):** Primary background. Deep, non-reflective.
    * **Lunar White (#F5F5F7):** Primary text and crescent accents.
    * **Crescent Silver (#A1A1A6):** Subtle borders and secondary data text.
    * **Nebula Slate (#1C1C1E):** Card backgrounds with low-opacity glassmorphism.

* **Typography:**
    * **Display:** *Cinzel* or *Trajan* (Roman Authority). Used for main headers.
    * **Body:** *Inter* (Clean, legible).
    * **Monospace:** *IBM Plex Mono* (Precision/OCR Verification).

## 2. The "Planet Emergence" Landing Page

The landing page is a single-scroll narrative experience.

### Phase 1: The Dark Void (0% Scroll)
* The user lands on a near-black screen.
* A 3D shadowed planet (textured like volcanic obsidian) sits off-center.
* **Copy:** "Orios. Financial Clarity, Emerging from the Dark."

### Phase 2: The Morning Crescent (20–60% Scroll)
* **The Motion:** As the user scrolls, the planet rotates. A sharp, white light bleeds from the edge, creating a "Morning Crescent" effect.
* **The Reveal:** Transparent "Visual Cards" emerge from the darkness into the light. These cards show snippets of parsed receipts (e.g., "Travel - $1,240.50").
* **The Interaction:** Cards have a floating, parallax movement as if caught in a gravitational pull.

### Phase 3: The Illumination (80%+ Scroll)
* The planet recedes into the background.
* The full "Modern Ledger" appears, showing how the darkness of messy emails is converted into organized, taxable light.

## 3. Product Architecture (The Portal)

### A. The Orbital Dashboard
Instead of traditional charts, the dashboard uses "Celestial Analytics":
* **Category Orbits:** Larger "planets" represent higher spending categories (e.g., Operations, Travel).
* **The Pulse:** A central light that glows when the "Orca" OCR engine is processing an incoming receipt.

### B. The Privacy-First Ledger
* **The "Valla" Barrier:** No bank connections. The ledger is fed exclusively via email forwarding to `[user]@orios.ca`.
* **Visual Verification:** Every line item in the ledger, when hovered, expands into a "Moonlight Card" showing the original receipt for audit-ready proof.

### C. The Executive Export
* A dedicated "Audit Ready" section.
* Allows for instant packaging of data into CSV, Excel, or a "Full Dossier" PDF that includes the images of the receipts for the accountant.
